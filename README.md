# Malicious-Hangman

This code is a version of Hangman where the computer maximizes the challenge. Instead of picking a word at the start, it waits, eliminating as many words as possible based on the playerâ€™s guesses. The word is only chosen when no further eliminations can be made, making each guess a strategic challenge.

Instructions:
1) Run Malicious_Hangman.py.
2) Input your preferred word length.
3) Decide on the number of attempts.
3) Start guessing letters.
4) If you guess the word within your chosen attempts, you win! If not, the word is revealed and you lose.
5) After each game, choose to play again or quit.
